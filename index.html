		<h1> Here is a story about a little girl, how she went to the wood and somethings about happened there...</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Once a upon a time, there was a child named Lily. Lily was a little girl, she was a scared of the big wide world. 
		She was born in a castle near to the wood. Every day she would wonder what was in the wood, but she never went in
		 the wood because she was too scared. Her parents told her their were monster and evil things in the woods which 
		made her even scared. Lily was a normal girl, but something was came in her head, it was about the wood.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Everyone told her not to go to the woods, but she didn't listen to them.
		 One day, Lily went into the scary woods and ran out becuase she was too scared to go in.
		 She ran to the castle and told that she wanted to learn more about the woods, but no one knew anything
		  about the woods beside it was dangerous, so they didn't say anything about it. When it was her 10<sup>th</sup> birthday, she walked into the woods, looking everywhere, so she would be safe. She tripped and saw a monster in front of her.</p>

		<p>The monster said<q>I will give you everythings you want if you let me inside and control you</q>. 
			Lily didn't know what that meant, so she was about to say yes, until... a FARIY kicked the moster and took her hand
			. Lily started running until it was too late, she was far away from the castle her home.
			 All the people in the caslte warned her about going in the wood, but she didn't listen.
			 The fariy saved the day and got Lily to her home, but the fairy died in the woods.
			 	The Monster came the caslte and cursed the whole family, so they all died on her 11<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>
